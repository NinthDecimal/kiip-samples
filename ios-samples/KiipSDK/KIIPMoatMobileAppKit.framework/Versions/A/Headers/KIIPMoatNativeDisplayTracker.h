/** Tracker for tracking Native ads - ads that are rendered using native UI elements rather than a WebView.
 * 
 * The class creates an internally managed WebView instance, loads our JavaScript tag into it, and then dispatches
 * viewability-related signals (pertaining to the native ad it is tracking) into that WebView.
 *
 * @warning Web-based ads, including "opaque" web containers (Google's DFPBannerView, etc.) 
 * are best tracked using MoatWebTracker instead
