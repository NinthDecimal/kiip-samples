/** Tracker for tracking Web View based ads.
 *
 * Web View based ads are ads that track:
 * 1. UIWebView class instances or subclasses of UIWebView
 * 2. WKWebiView class instances or subclasses of WKWebiView
 * 3. Google Mobile Ads (GMA) Banner ads, for example DFPBannerView
 * 4. Hybrid native-webview ads (a very rare case)
 *
 * Each tracker instance must be kept around for the lifetime of the ad impression that it is tracking.
